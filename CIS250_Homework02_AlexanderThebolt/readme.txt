Program 1

How I did it:
This program was easily the hardest of the three to code. I ran into a lot of programs
mostly because I wasn't really thinking when I started coding it, so I made a lot of
mistakes in the code that took me hours to find. This got very stressful at times because
the program made sense when I read through it line by line, but it would give an error.
Once I finally figured out the problems, I just copy/pasted most of the work from the first
homework because it was basically the exact same thing. The hardest part besides finding my
tiny mistakes was figuring out how to nest the classes, more specifically, how to set the
attributes of the nested class without using the nested class's name.

What it does:
This program is a menu with 6 options that display details about employees and departments.
The information is provided from a text file which can be switched for a different text file.


Program 2

How I did it:
I just followed the directions given in the book. This program was very easy to code.

What it does:
The program asks for the user to enter a radius.
Then it calculates and displays the area, diameter and circumference.


Program 3

How I did it:
I followed the directions in the book for making my class and my functions. This program was
pretty easy. I thought about making a single player mode or the option for the user to enter
their own questions, but I changed my mind.

What it does:
This program is a game that requires 2 players. The two players compete for the highest score
by answering 5 trivia questions about me. The player with the highest score wins. The program
already has 10 questions hardcoded that will be used for the game.
